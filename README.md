# OhmCalculator
Calculates Voltage, Amps, Resistance, and Power
Steps:
1. Provide at least two known values
2. Access the dropdown menu to the select the known value combos
3. Once the known values are calculated, you can adjust the values of each input box to refine the required calculations for whatever project you're working on.
(Ex: Providing Voltage and Watts to determine which type of ampere breaker would be nessessary. 
Dont forget that NEC standard requires you to calculate an additional 15% for circuit breakers)

Intended patches:
1. Make the page prettier.
2. Phase out the dropdown menu for an instant calculations.
3. Provide a type and gauge of wire option which influences wire resistance. (ex: Copper/aluminum/copper coated aluminum/)
4. In additon to #3, perhaps provide the options of different types of metal. (ex: gold, silver, iron, etc)
5. Provide a distance of wire option which will calculate voltage drop. (ex: 10 ft vs. 100 ft)
6. Added graphics for beautifying, educating, and warning.
